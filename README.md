How It Works
Choose Difficulty Level:

Easy: Simple words and short sentences.
Medium: Moderately complex words and sentences.
Hard: Long, complex sentences with advanced vocabulary.
Typing Test:

Once a level is selected, the user will be presented with a series of words/sentences to type within a given time limit.
The application will track the number of correct keystrokes, typing speed (in words per minute), and errors made.
Performance Report:

After completing the test, a performance report will be generated. The report includes:
Words Per Minute (WPM): Speed of typing based on the number of correctly typed words.
Accuracy: Percentage of correctly typed characters compared to total characters typed.
Error Count: Number of incorrect words or characters typed.
